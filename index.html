	    <p><span style="font-size: 15px; text-shadow: red 4px 4px 5px;">Chocolate is a</span> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Mini Doberman</span>   that my father brought home when I was in fifth grade. She accompanied me through childhood, and I felt lucky to have her in my family. Her personality is slightly different than other Mini Dobermans because she is extremely friendly to our family and friends when we pet her. Sometimes I dress her up after the shower, like Little Red Riding Hood. When she hears something "wired," she will tilt her head and look at me.

	   <p> She is eleven years old, and I am worried about her condition. The fundamental reason is that she had sudden epilepsy the previous month. My mother took her to the veterinary hospital for examination and gave her a sling. Now her condition is getting better and much more stable. Hope Chocolate can always be with us happily and healthily.
